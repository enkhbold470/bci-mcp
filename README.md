# Brain-Computer Interface with Model Context Protocol (BCI-MCP)

This project integrates Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create a powerful framework for neural signal acquisition, processing, and AI-enabled interactions.

## Overview

BCI-MCP combines:

- **Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)**: Real-time acquisition and processing of neural signals
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Standardized AI communication interface 

This integration enables advanced applications in healthcare, accessibility, research, and human-computer interaction.

## Key Features

### BCI Core Features

- Neural Signal Acquisition: Capture electrical signals from brain activity in real-time
- Signal Processing: Preprocess, extract features, and classify brain signals
- Command Generation: Convert interpreted brain signals into commands
- Feedback Mechanisms: Provide feedback to help users improve control
- Real-time Operation: Process brain activity with minimal delay

### MCP Integration Features

- Standardized Context Sharing: Connect BCI data with AI models using MCP
- Tool Exposure: Make BCI functions available to AI applications
- Composable Workflows: Build complex operations combining BCI signals and AI processing
- Secure Data Exchange: Enable privacy-preserving neural data transmission
